Sentaurus TCAD simulations of Pd/IWO/HfO₂ thin-film transistors for 3D BEOL integration

📖 Overview

This repository contains my work on thin-film transistor (TFT) simulations for 3D Back-End-of-Line (BEOL) integration using Synopsys Sentaurus TCAD. The project focuses on analyzing device behavior, scaling limits, and material properties of a Pd/IWO/HfO₂ transistor structure, designed to enable low-power, high-density circuits in advanced 3D integration.
